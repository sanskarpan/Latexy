## ðŸš€ Getting Started

After completing each phase, update this checklist by marking tasks as complete `[x]` and add any notes or deviations from the plan. Each phase should be fully tested and validated before moving to the next one.

The project should remain functional and deployable after each phase, enabling incremental delivery and user feedback throughout the development process.
