# Latexy
Accepts LaTeX resume source (partial snippet or full .tex) + a Job Description (JD) or role text.  Analyzes the JD to extract role keywords, skills, seniority, and scoring criteria for ATS.  Produces an ATS-optimized LaTeX resume (edits/rewrites, formatting, keyword alignment, readability) and compiles to PDF.

Further planned for more input formats.
